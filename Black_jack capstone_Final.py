"""
This is a Blackjack game that a player can play against the computer. The goal of this game is for the player to have a higher hand than the dealer but less than or equal 21. The player can keep asking for cards, but he/she will lose if they go higher than 21. To make it more interesting the player can bet money. If they win they will get double the bet. 

First, the game will ask the player how much they will bet. Then the computer will issue two cards for itself and give them 2 cards. The computerâ€™s hand will not be shown. The player can then keep asking for more cards but as soon as they go over 21 the computer will tell them that they lost. Once the player stops asking for cards they will be told if they won or lost. It will ask the player if they want to play again. If yes then the code loops, if no then the game ends
